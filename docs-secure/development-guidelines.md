# Internal Development Guidelines

## Code Review and Deployment

### Development Workflow
All code changes must follow our established workflow:

1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create feature branches from `main`
2. **Code Development**: Implement features with comprehensive testing
3. **Pull Request**: Submit PR with detailed description and test results
4. **Code Review**: Minimum 2 reviewers required for approval
5. **Integration Testing**: Automated testing pipeline execution
6. **Deployment**: Staged deployment through dev → staging → production

### Security Requirements
- All dependencies must be scanned for vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 compliance mandatory
- Regular security audits scheduled quarterly
- Penetration testing before major releases

### API Development Standards
- RESTful API design principles
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification documentation
- Rate limiting implementation required
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Customer Data Access Protocols

### Database Access Controls
- Production database access restricted to senior developers
- All queries logged and monitored
- Customer PII access requires manager approval
- Regular access reviews conducted monthly

### API Security Implementation
```python
# Example secure endpoint implementation
@app.post("/customer/data")
@require_auth
@rate_limit(requests=100, window=3600)
async def get_customer_data(
    request: CustomerDataRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Validate user has permission for requested customer
    if not has_customer_access(current_user, request.customer_id):
        raise HTTPException(403, "Access denied")
    
    # Log access attempt
    audit_log.info(f"Customer data access: {current_user.id} -> {request.customer_id}")
    
    return await customer_service.get_data(request.customer_id)
```

### Audit Trail Requirements
- All data access logged with user ID, timestamp, and accessed records
- Logs retained for minimum 7 years
- Regular audit trail reviews by compliance team
- Automated alerting for suspicious access patterns

## Integration Specifications

### SharePoint Integration
- **Authentication**: Service principal with limited permissions
- **Data Sync**: Real-time updates via webhooks
- **File Processing**: Automated document ingestion pipeline
- **Version Control**: Document versioning maintained in vector store

### Azure AD Integration
- **Tenant Configuration**: Multi-tenant support for customer organizations
- **Group Mapping**: Automatic role assignment based on AD groups
- **Conditional Access**: Device compliance and location restrictions
- **Token Management**: Refresh token rotation and revocation

### Zendesk Integration
- **Ticket Creation**: Automatic ticket generation for unresolved queries
- **Customer Linking**: Automatic customer identification and linking
- **Priority Routing**: VIP customer priority escalation
- **SLA Monitoring**: Response time tracking and alerts

## Performance and Monitoring

### Application Performance
- **Response Time**: API endpoints must respond within 200ms (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: Minimum 1000 requests/second capacity
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA requirement
- **Error Rate**: Less than 0.1% error rate target

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring
- **Database Performance**: Query performance and connection pooling
- **Cache Hit Ratios**: Redis cache performance optimization
- **Cost Optimization**: Regular AWS cost analysis and optimization

### Alerting Configuration
- **Critical Alerts**: P1 incidents with immediate escalation
- **Warning Alerts**: Performance degradation notifications
- **Business Metrics**: Customer satisfaction and usage analytics
- **Security Events**: Failed authentication and suspicious activity

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Procedures
- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Code Repository**: Multiple geographic git repository mirrors
- **Configuration Management**: Infrastructure as code with version control
- **Document Storage**: SharePoint backup to secondary Azure region

### Recovery Procedures
- **RTO**: Recovery Time Objective of 4 hours maximum
- **RPO**: Recovery Point Objective of 1 hour maximum
- **Failover Testing**: Monthly disaster recovery drills
- **Communication Plan**: Automated customer and stakeholder notifications
